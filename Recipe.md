5. Place plates in steamer and steam for 10-12 minutes over medium flame.

6. After 10-12 minutes, insert a knife or toothpick into dhokla and check if it comes out clean. If it does, then it is ready otherwise cook 2-3 minutes more.

7. Takeout plates from steamer and let them cool for few minutes. Cut fluffy khaman dhokla into small squares using knife.
