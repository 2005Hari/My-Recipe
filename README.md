**Dhokla** is a [vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian) culinary dish that is found mainly in the [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) state of [Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat) and parts of adjacent states. It is made with a [fermented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food)) [batter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batter_(cooking)) derived from [rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice) and split [chickpeas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickpea).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhokla#cite_note-2) Dhokla can be eaten for breakfast, as a main course, as a side dish, or as a snack. Dhokla is very similar to [Khaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaman), however Dhokla is made of batter derived from mixture of rice flour and chickpea flour, whereas Khaman is typically made from [Chickpeas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickpea) gram and looks yellow in color. [Khaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaman) has become widely popular outside Gujarat but is misunderstood or incorrectly known as Dhokla.
